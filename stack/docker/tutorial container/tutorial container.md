First, if you want to learn, then, execute,

```Bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 dockersamples/101-tutorial
```

`-d` → run in the background (detached mode)

`-p` → port

and the last part `dockersamples/101-tutorial` means the name of the container

docker images list,

`docker images`

docker running process,

`docker ps`
