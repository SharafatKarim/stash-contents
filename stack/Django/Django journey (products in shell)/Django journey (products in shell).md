To get started in the shell, execute,

`python manage.py shell`

shell looks beautiful, right?

to access `DateField()` import `timezone`

```Python
from django.utils import timezone
```

and also import like this,

```Python
Prod = Product(product_name='keyboard',category='key',subcategory='',price=150,de
    ...: sc='somehting that we use daily', pub_date= timezone.now())
```

And finally,

```Python
Prod.save()
```

You can list all by, `Product.objects.all()`

And even more at itâ€™s documentations, good luck!
