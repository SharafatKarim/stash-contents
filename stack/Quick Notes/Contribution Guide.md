## Creating and editing

I use **notion** to create or edit pages for this website. Though I like **Obsidian** more than notion, but for online sync purpose and accessing from android or other platforms I kept notion!

## Notion?

It’s a note talking app with advanced features compared to **Google Keep**. It has a lot of features even in the free mode and I think free plan is more than enough.

## Contribution

Just tell me if you want to contribute. I’ll give you access to my notion’s page. Then you can log into notion from any platform with your own account without any hassle!

## Markdown fan?

You can paste your markdown syntax in notion directly and it’ll arrange them for you automatically.
